# MultiOgar-Edited-Unlimited

A fast, open source server that supports multiple protocol versions and smooth vanilla physics.

Since August of 2017, [Tyler3D](https://github.com/Tyler3D) has stopped working on this project. So I forked the code and remade it into MultiOgar-Edited-Unlimited. An updated version of the previous MultiOgar.

## Information
Current version : **1.0.0**

Original MultiOgar code is based on the private server implementation [Cigar](https://github.com/CigarProject/Cigar). The original code rightfully belongs to the [CigarProject](https://github.com/CigarProject).

MultiOgar-Edited-Unlimited code however, is based on MultiOgar code that has been heavily modified and improved by many collaborators. The overall goal of this fork is to make physics as vanilla as possible, cleanup most of the code, and add lots of new features while maintaining better performance than the original MultiOgar.
